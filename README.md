# Fibre Yield Prediction Using Process Data

This project builds a regression model to predict fibre yield in pulp and paper operations using real-world process parameters. It demonstrates how industrial data can be leveraged for predictive analytics and operational optimization.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Fibre yield is a critical metric in pulp production, influenced by multiple process variables such as wood type, chemical dosage, and operational conditions. Accurate prediction enables better resource planning and cost control.

## 🧪 Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable relationships
- Cleaned and preprocessed data, handling outliers and missing values
- Built regression models using Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluated model performance using R² and RMSE

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest model achieved 74% accuracy (R² score)
- Identified key drivers: wood type, chemical dosage, and temperature
- Delivered actionable insights for improving fibre yield and reducing waste

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Domain expertise in pulp and paper operations
